# Carbon Emission Optimization Mode for Laptop/PC

## Overview

The **Carbon Emission Optimization Mode for Laptop/PC** is a software solution designed to monitor and optimize carbon emissions generated by applications running on laptops and PCs. By evaluating the carbon footprint of active applications based on their runtime, RAM usage, and CPU consumption, this tool automatically manages application usage to maintain emissions below a specified threshold.

## Features

- **Real-time Monitoring:** Continuously tracks and displays the performance metrics of running applications, including runtime, RAM usage, and CPU usage.
- **Automatic Optimization:** Closes non-essential applications when the overall carbon emissions exceed the defined threshold, effectively reducing the carbon footprint.
- **User-Friendly Interface:** Built using Tkinter, providing an intuitive graphical user experience for easy interaction.
- **Automation:** Implements batch scripting to ensure seamless execution of all components of the application.

## Technologies Used

- **Programming Languages:** 
  - C: For system-level interaction and gathering application metrics.
  - Python: For backend processing and logic.
- **Frameworks/Libraries:** 
  - Tkinter: For creating the GUI.
- **Automation Tools:** 
  - Batch scripting: For automating the execution of various components.

## Installation

To set up the project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Carbon-Emission-Optimization-Mode-for-Laptop-PC.git
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd Carbon-Emission-Optimization-Mode-for-Laptop-PC
3. Run the App.bat

## Usage

- Launch the application to start monitoring running applications.
- The application will display real-time metrics and automatically close unnecessary applications when carbon emissions exceed the threshold.
