# Carbon-Emission-Optimization-Mode-for-Laptop-PC
This project aims to optimize carbon emissions on laptops and PCs by intelligently monitoring and managing application usage. It evaluates the carbon footprint of running applications based on their runtime, RAM usage, and CPU consumption, automatically closing unnecessary apps to maintain emissions below a defined threshold.
